  Note: if you are actively using tabs in VIM, this script will probably be of no use to you.

  The script is pretty similar to the miniBufExpl, except it uses vim |tabline| instead of dedicated split to show your buffer list. For detailed user manual type ":h BufLine" command after you install the srcipt.
